This program is meant to be run on a Linux machine with access to Intel
compilers (ifort, mpiifort, etc.) If you don't have those compilers, the
following link will walk you through downloading free versions:

You will need the base kit and the HPC kit. Once that is finished, you
can move onto the compilation. First, this program uses 2 outside
libraries: fftpack and lapack. Both of these are in the git repository.

To install/compile lapack:
1. Go to /fortran/lib
2. Unzip the lapack.tgz file with
    tar -xzvf lapack.tgz
    This will likely take a minute.
3. Compile: copy the make.inc file in /lib into the new directory
    (lapack-3.9.0). Move into this directory and run:
    make
    There might be some issues. If so, there's some compilation tips in
    the /lib folder under comp_tips. likely you will need to run
    the command
    ulimit -s unlimited
4. The compilation will likely take quite a while (maybe up to 15 min)

To compile fftpack:
1. Go to /fortran/FFTs
2. Run
    ifort -c fftpack.f90
3. You should be good to go!

To compile the code, simply navigate to /fortran/ and run
    make
It will likely take a good bit. You will get an executable called harms.
To run it in sequential mode, run
    ./harms file.mfs
Where file.mfs is your input file (default: noBgrint.mfs)
