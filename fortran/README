This program is meant to be run on a Linux machine with access to Intel
compilers (ifort, mpiifort, etc.) If you don't have those compilers, the
following link will walk you through downloading free versions:

You will need the base kit and the HPC kit. Once that is finished, you
can move onto the compilation. 

To make, just go to the main directory (BEM/) and run make
The solver will be in the fortran directory. You can run make
in the individual directories as well. It will probably take
5 minutes or so all told, give or take.

If you don't have access to MPI (e.g. you have a Mac), you can still
compile in sequential mode with
    make seq=1
It will likely take a good bit. You will get an executable called harms.

To run in parallel (only needed for multiple cells) run
    mpirun -n=NP ./harms file.mfs
Where file.mfs is your input file (default: noBgrint.mfs) and
NP is the number of processors

To run it in sequential mode, run
    ./harms file.mfs
