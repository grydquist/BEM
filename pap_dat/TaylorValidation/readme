all timesteps are .005 and should go out to 5 s, except 0.01. it has .0025,
and I stopped it because it was done.

The Lac paper uses a value called 2*Gs, equivalent to B. Interestingly,
the value of C they use is equal to my B*C. All values for their C here are 1,
meaning B = C in my sims

At low Ca, there's some instability that degrafes accuracy, but is fixed with smaller time step

These are for Ca in Lac: Ca = 2a mu gam/B, because  2Gs = B !!!!!!!!! Check this to make sure

The Capillary numbers I used (B & C values they correspond to) are:
0.01   200
0.05   40
0.1    20
0.15   13.333333
0.25   8
0.5    4
0.75   2.666667
1      2
1.25   1.6
1.5    1.33333
2      1
2.5    0.8

Same Cas were done at a viscosity ratio of 5, but I bumped the timestep to 0.01 for some because I needed to run them out further
The timesteps are all over the place and not labeled.
